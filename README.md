# Wealth Manager

This is my first attempt building a CLI application in Rust. I have used the example given in the book
[Speed Up Your Python with Rust: Optimize Python Performance by Creating Python Pip Modules in Rust with PyO3](
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Speed-Your-Python-Rust-performance/dp/180181144X
). I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning how to use Rust to speed up your Python code.
